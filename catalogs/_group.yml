                The
                <a class="underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://arcoiris.ucolick.org/candels/"
                  >Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Survey (CANDELS)</a
                >
                is a multi-wavelength deep sky survey anchored in a Multi-cycle Treasury program with the Hubble Space
                Telescope (HST; PI S. Faber & H. Ferguson). CANDELS took Near-IR images with the Wide Field Camera 3
                (WFC3) in five fields that were already well studied at many different wavelengths: COSMOS, EGS, GOODS-N,
                GOODS-S, and the UDS. The CANDELS team and the community have compiled extensive ancillary observations,
                both imaging and spectroscopy, in these fields. Physical parameters such as redshifts, stellar masses,
                star formation rates, etc., have been estimated from the Spectral Energy Distributions (SED).
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of the CANDELS program, the theory team created custom "mock CANDELS" catalogs. These were created
                by extracting the dark matter halos from a large cosmological simulation along the past lightcone
                corresponding to a field with the same geometry and sky location as one of the real CANDELS fields. These
                halos are then populated with galaxy properties using two different techniques: an empirical technique
                known as Sub-Halo Abundance Matching (using the UniverseMachine built by P. Behroozi & collaborators), and
                Semi-analytic Models of galaxy formation.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to facilitate comparison between theoretical models and the CANDELS observations, we have created
                a set of curated "theory friendly" catalogs for the CANDELS observed quantities and physical properties
                derived from the observations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This site is a portal to explore and compare the "theory friendly" CANDELS observational catalogs and
                three of the sets of CANDELS mock catalogs: SC-SAM (created by R. Somerville & collaborators), Lu-SAM (Y.
                Lu & collaborators), and UniverseMachine (P. Behroozi & collaborators). For each of these models, mock catalogs have been created representing the sky locations of each of the five CANDELS fields. There are eight realizations of each CANDELS field sky region.

              <h4>Project summary</h4>
              <p>
                <em><a class="underline" href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/semi-analytic-forecasts">Semi-analytic forecasts for the Universe</a></em> is an ongoing project that provides physically motivated predictions for the properties and demographics of galaxies and quasars forming across cosmic time in the Universe. We provide a wide variety of scientific predictions and simulated data products that are designed to be useful for optimizing observing strategies, physically interpreting observational results, and ultimately maximizing the scientific output of galaxy surveys.
              </p>
              <p>
              These predictions are made with the well-established Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) for galaxy formation. Taking advantage of the physically motivated and yet computationally efficient model, we provide predictions for tens of millions of galaxies across wide ranges of mass and redshift. Over the course of 7 publications, we stringently examined the model outputs against a wide variety of observational constraints available to date, including distribution functions for rest-frame UV magnitude, stellar mass, star formation rate, and a variety of scaling relations. We showed that the model reproduces constraints well up to z ~ 10. In the series of Forecasts papers, we use NASA’s flagship observatories <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov">James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</a> and <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov">Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)</a> as practical examples to demonstrate how these predictions can be used.
              </p>
              <p>
                We provide three sets of simulated lightcones: 1) a set of 40 wide-field lightcones, each spanning ~1,000 sq. arcmin with footprints overlapping the five <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.2706Y/abstract">CANDELS</a> legacy fields, resolving galaxies down to M*~10^7 Msun; 2) a set of 8 deep-field lightcones, each spanning 132 sq. arcmin with footprints overlapping the HUDF, resolving galaxies down to M*~5.7x10^7 Msun; and 3) a set of 5 ultra-wide lightcones, each spanning 2 sq degrees, with resolution matching the wide-field lightcones. For all three sets of catalogs, we provide observed-frame photometry for JWST (NIRCam), Roman (WFI), Hubble (WFC3/ACS), Spitzer, Euclid, Rubin, GALEX, SDSS, UKIRT, VISTA, and DECam, as well as rest-frame luminosity for NUV, FUV, and Johnson/Bessel/Cousins bands, and a wide variety of predicted physical properties for halos and galaxies.
