  Streams And their Progenitors in FIRE cosmological simulations<br>
  Panithanpaisal et al 2021.<br>
  This is a catalogue of present-day simulated stellar streams with galaxy
  progenitors. These streams are selected from the Latte suite and ElVIS
  suite of FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of isolated and paired Milky
  Way-mass galaxies. The stream classification and determination of important
  timescales are described in detail in Panithanpaisal et al 2021.
