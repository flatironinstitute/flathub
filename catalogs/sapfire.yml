  Streams And their Progenitors in FIRE cosmological simulations<br>
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09660">Panithanpaisal et al 2021.</a><br>
  This is a catalogue of present-day simulated stellar streams with galaxy
  progenitors. These streams are selected from the Latte suite and ElVIS
  suite of FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of isolated and paired Milky
  Way-mass galaxies. The stream classification and determination of important
  timescales are described in detail in Panithanpaisal et al 2021.<br>
  Accompanying potential models for all of the simulations can be found <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dynamics/data/pot_models/">here</a>.<br>
