                AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project
              </a>
              investigates galaxy formation with high-resolution simulations and
              compares the results across code platforms and with observations.
              The goal is to verify that the astrophysical assumptions are
              responsible for any success in galaxy simulations, not artifacts
              of particular numerical implementations. By guaranteeing
              reproducibility, we aim to improve numerical experiments as one of
              the most powerful tools in formulating theories of galaxy
              formation. This is a one-of-a-kind, inter-institutional effort by
              more than 160 participants from over 60 institutions worldwide. We
              welcome anybody who is interested in participating in the AGORA
              project, especially with new codes.
            </p>

              The AGORA infrastructure include common cosmological initial
              conditions (4 halo masses and 2 assembly histories generated using
              MUSIC), common isolated initial conditions (generated with
              MakeDisk), common astrophysics models (cooling and UV background
              implemented via the GRACKLE package), and a common analysis
              platform (yt toolkit), all publicly available to the community.
              Using the components assembled, the ongoing collaborative efforts
              aim to increase the realism of numerical experiments collectively,
              resulting in multiple publications in the next few years.
